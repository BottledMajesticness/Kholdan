# a silly game engine development toolkit
  
## Chapter 1: What is Kholdan?
Hi, nice to meet you there, this is ***Kholdan***.  

This is a collection of classes and examples (a library, i suppose) along with tutorials, to help people of any kind and background with creating their personal game engines.

### is this a game engine?
Not really, this is at most merely a game development framework (like XNA or Flash), or even more harshly put just a bunch of simple classes.  
This is the case if we take into account only the code part of the project.  

But this is not just a bunch of simple classes, **Kholdan** is a collection of classes and examples along with *tutorials*.

Tutorials are the reason for I wanted to start working Kholdan. The goal of this project is not just to give you the codebase needed to create a simple game engine, but to teach you one of the many approaches towards creating game engines for personal use.
### why would one ever want to make a game engine?
## Chapter 2: Why would you want to make a game engine?
There are a lot of different reasons for why one would want to make their own game engine, but I guess it'd be nice to list a few.
### 1. Knowing what you're working with
There is a good chance you don't really know how the engines you tend to use work inside in great detail (unless you are a contributor or the developer of those engines, and for that I salute you).  

Most of the times, it's not really a problem,  
but sometimes *it is*.  

And when it is, people tend to write their own workarounds that then they slap on top of the engine. This is both unelegant (though all coding is, to be frank) and most importantly not fun.  
Trying to make your code cooperate with the game engine can be a big pain in your gluteus maximus, but if you make your own engine you get to know all of the inner workings of the engine.  

So even if you need to write code that doesn't really work with the game engine, **you can just extend it**.
